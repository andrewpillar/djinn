# Disks denotes the location on the filesystem where the QEMU image files should
# be loaded from. It is expected for the base QEMU images to exist in the _base
# directory directly beneath. Within this _base directory should be another
# directory for each supported architecture that the QEMU driver can emulate.
# For example,
#
#   /var/lib/djinn/images/qemu/_base/x86_64
#
# would contain images for 64-bit emulation. Beyond this, there is no more
# expectation as to how things are structured, for example you could have your
# image files laid out like so,
#
#   /var/lib/djinn/images/qemu/_base/x86_64/centos/7
#
# or like so,
#
#   /var/lib/djinn/images/qemu/_base/x86_64/centos-7
#
# all that would matter then is how the image is referenced in a build's
# manifest, for example,
#
#   driver:
#       type: qemu
#       image: centos/7
#
# or using the latter example
#
#   driver:
#       type: qemu
#       image: centos-7
